Universal Spotify Scrobbling required to capture playback through Google Home and similar devices.
    - Async process to capture user's current playback information
        - Get duration and current progress
        - Scrobble if current progress / duration > 75%
        - May need to look at timestamp or other metrics to ensure song play is not scrobled twice
        - May need to hold data for scrobbling and wait to transmit scrobble until Last.FM can be polled to see if play was already scrobbled
            - Alternatively, Last.FM can be polled for currently playing to make determination at time of scrobble
    - All of the above are COMPLETED!
    - Process still needed to handle login and multiple listener's for multiple users
    - Private Session accounted for when attempting to scrobble track, but still looking for a way to determine earlier so that we don't update playing when session is private.  May just set a flag based on the existence of the previous track in recent_tracks.
